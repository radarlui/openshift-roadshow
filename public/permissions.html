<div class="paragraph">
<p>Almost every interaction with an OpenShift environment that you can think of
requires going through the master&#8217;s API. All API interactions are both
authenticated (AuthN - who are you?) and authorized (AuthZ - are you allowed to
do what you are asking?).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the log aggregation lab we saw that there was an
error in reference to a <strong>Service Account</strong>.Just like a user has
permissions (AuthZ), sometimes we may wish for non-users to be able to perform
actions against the API. These "non-users" are referred to as service accounts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenShift automatically creates a few special service accounts in every project.
The <strong>default</strong> service account has its credentials automatically injected into
every pod that is launched. By changing the permissions for that service
account, we can do interesting things.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="_exercise_grant_service_account_view_permissions">Exercise: Grant Service Account View Permissions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The parksmap application wants to talk to the OpenShift API to learn about other
<strong>Pods</strong>, <strong>Services</strong>, and resources within the <strong>Project</strong>. You&#8217;ll learn why soon!</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock copypaste">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>$ oc project explore-XX</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>$ oc policy add-role-to-user view -z default</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>oc policy</code> command above is giving a defined <em>role</em> (<code>view</code>) to a user. But
we are using a special flag, <code>-z</code>. What does this flag do? From the <code>-h</code> output:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>-z, --serviceaccount=[]: service account in the current namespace to use as a user</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>-z</code> syntax is a special one that saves us from having to type out the
entire string, which, in this case, is
<code>system:serviceaccount:explore-XX:default</code>. It&#8217;s a nifty shortcut.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>-z</code> flag will only work for service accounts in the <strong>current</strong> namespace.
Beware of this if you attempt to use it in the future.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that the default <strong>Service Account</strong> has <strong>view</strong> access, it can query the API
to see what resources are within the <strong>Project</strong>. This also has the added benefit
of supressing the error message! Although, in reality, we fixed the application.</p>

<h3 id="_exercise_grant_user_view_permissions">Exercise: Grant User View Permissions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you create a project, you are that project&#8217;s administrator. This means that
you can grant access to other users, too. If you like, give your neighbor view
access to your <code>explore</code> project using the following command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock copypaste">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>$ oc policy add-role-to-user view userXX</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Have them go to the project view by clicking the <strong>Projects</strong> button and verify
that they can see your project and its resources. This type of arrangement (view
but not edit) might be ideal for a developer getting visibility into a
production application&#8217;s project.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_exercise_redeploy_application">Exercise: Redeploy Application</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One more step is required. We need to re-deploy the application because it&#8217;s
given up trying to query the API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This time we&#8217;ll use the web console. Find your <code>explore-XX</code> project,
and then click "Applications" and then "Deployments". You&#8217;ll see your only
application, <code>parksmap</code>, listed. Click that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The deployment screen tells you a lot about how the application will be
deployed. At the top right, there is a button labeled "Deploy". This button will
cause a new deployment (which you know creates a new <strong>ReplicationController</strong>,
right?).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Click it.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/api/workshops/roadshow/content/assets/images/new-parksmap-deploy.png" alt="Deploy Button">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll see that a new deployment is immediately started. Return to the overview
page and watch it happen. You might not be fast enough! If you look at the logs
for the application now, you should see no errors.  That&#8217;s great.</p>
