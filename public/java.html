<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this lab, we&#8217;re going to deploy a backend service, developed in Java
programming language that will expose 2 main REST endpoints to the visualizer
application (<code>parksmap</code> web component that was deployed in the previous labs).
The application will query for national parks information (including it&#8217;s
coordinates) that is stored in a Mongo database.  This application will also
provide an external access point, so that the API provided can be directly used
by the end user.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a previous lab, we learned how to deploy a pre-existing Docker-formatted
image. Now we will expand on that a bit by learning how OpenShift builds a
Docker images using source code from an existing repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image">Source-to-Image (S2I)</a> is another
open source project sponsored by Red Hat. Its goal:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>Source-to-image (S2I) is a tool for building reproducible Docker images. S2I
produces ready-to-run images by injecting source code into a Docker image and
assembling a new Docker image which incorporates the builder image and built
source. The result is then ready to use with docker run. S2I supports
incremental builds which re-use previously downloaded dependencies, previously
built artifacts, etc.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenShift is S2I-enabled and can use S2I as one of its build mechanisms (in
addition to building Docker images from Dockerfiles, and "custom" builds).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenShift runs the S2I process inside a special <strong>Pod</strong>, called a Build
Pod, and thus builds are subject to quotas, limits, resource scheduling, and
other aspects of OpenShift.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A full discussion of S2I is beyond the scope of this class, but you can find
more information about it either in the
<a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/creating_images/s2i.html">OpenShift S2I documentation</a>
or on GitHub (following the link above). The only key concept you need to
remember about S2I is that it&#8217;s magic.</p>

<h3 id="_exercise_creating_a_java_application">Exercise: Creating a Java application</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The backend service that we will be deploying as part of this exercise is
called <code>nationalparks</code>.  This is a Java Spring Boot application that performs 2D
geo-spatial queries against a MongoDB database to locate and return map
coordinates of all National Parks in the world. That was just a fancy way of
saying that we are going to deploy a webservice that returns a JSON list of
places.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_add_to_project">Add to Project</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because the <code>nationalparks</code> application is a back-end to serve data that our
existing front-end will consume, we are going to build it inside the existing
<code>explore-XX</code> project. And, we will do it from the web console.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_using_application_code_on_embedded_gitlab">Using application code on embedded GitLab</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenShift can work with any accessible Git repository. This could be GitHub,
GitLab, or any other server that speaks Git. You can even register webhooks in
your Git server to initiate OpenShift builds triggered by any update to the
application code!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The repository that we are going to use is already cloned in the internal GitLab repository
and located at the following URL:</p>

<h4 id="_build_the_code_on_openshift">Build the Code on OpenShift</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similar to how we used "Add to project" before with a Docker-formatted image, we
can do the same for specifying a source code repository. Since for this lab you
have your own GitLab repository, let&#8217;s use it with a simple Java S2I image.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the OpenShift web console, find your <code>explore-XX</code> project, and then
click the <strong>"Add to Project"</strong> button. You will see a list of categories of
runtimes, and other types of components that you can deploy and run on OpenShift.</p>

<p>These labs were written against specific points in time for these

concept of <strong>Branches/Tags</strong>. Click on <strong>Show advanced routing, build, and deployment

process to grab that specific tag in the code repository.</p>
