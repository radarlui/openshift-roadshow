<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clustering in JBoss EAP is achieved using the Kubernetes discovery mechanism for
finding other JBoss EAP containers and forming a cluster. This is done by
configuring the JGroups protocol stack in <code>standalone-openshift.xml</code> with
<code>&lt;openshift.KUBE_PING/&gt;</code> elements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For <code>KUBE_PING</code> to work, the following steps must be taken:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The <code>OPENSHIFT_KUBE_PING_NAMESPACE</code> environment variable must be set. If not
set, the server will act as if it is a single-node cluster (a "cluster of
one").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>OPENSHIFT_KUBE_PING_LABELS</code> environment variables should be set. If not
set, pods outside of your application (albeit in your namespace) will try to
join.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authorization must be granted to the service account the pod is running under
to be allowed to access Kubernetes' REST api.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You have already configured the default service account to have access to
Kubernetes' REST api during previous labs. Now you can scale up the <strong>mlbparks</strong>
pod to two by clicking on the upper arrows on the console. Alternatively, you
can use the command line to scale up the pods and form a two-member cluster.</p>
</div>

<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>$ oc scale dc/mlbparks --replicas=2</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For pods based on Java images, the web console also exposes access to a
hawt.io-based JVM console for viewing and managing any relevant Java components.
A link is displayed in the pod&#8217;s details on the <strong>Applications</strong> &rarr; <strong>Pods</strong> page,
provided the container has a port named jolokia. On the console, click on
mlbparks pods, then on any of the two pods deployed. On the <strong>Details</strong> tab, click
on <strong>Open Java Console</strong>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the Java Console, use the <strong>JMX</strong> browser and click on <strong>jgroups &rarr; channel
&rarr; ee</strong>. The right pane shows the list of clustering JMX attributes including
<strong>view</strong> which is the current state of the cluster. This attribute shows the name
of two pods which are currently members of the cluster. When <strong>mlbparks</strong> pod gets
scaled up or down, JBoss EAP gets notified by calling Kubernetes' REST API and
updates the cluster status based on the number of pods available.</p>
