<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing we want to do to ensure that our <code>oc</code> command line tools was
installed and successfully added to our path is login to the OpenShift
environment that has been provided for this Roadshow session.  In
order to login, we will use the <code>oc</code> command and then specify the server that we
want to authenticate to.  Issue the following command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>$ oc login astri-ihub.org:8443</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may see the following output:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>The server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority.
You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted by others.
Use insecure connections? (y/n):</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enter in <strong>Y</strong> to use a potentially insecure connection.  The reason you received
this message is because we are using a self-signed certificate for this
workshop, but we did not provide you with the CA certificate that was generated
by OpenShift. In a real-world scenario, either OpenShift&#8217;s certificate would be
signed by a standard CA (eg: Thawte, Verisign, StartSSL, etc.) or signed by a
corporate-standard CA that you already have installed on your system.</p>

<p>On some versions of Microsoft Windows, you may get an error that the
server has an invalid x.509 certificate.  If you receive this error, enter in
the following command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>$ oc login astri-ihub.org:8443 --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</td>
</tr>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you issue the <code>oc login</code> command, you will be prompted for the username and
password combination for your user account:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock copypaste">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>Username: userXX
Password: openshift3</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you have authenticated to the OpenShift server, you will see the
following confirmation message:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>Login successful.

Using project "explore-XX".</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Congratulations, you are now authenticated to the OpenShift server. The
OpenShift master includes a built-in OAuth server. Developers and administrators
obtain OAuth access tokens to authenticate themselves to the API. By default
your authorization token will last for 24 hours. There is more information about
the login command and its configuration in the <a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#basic-setup-and-login">OpenShift Documentation</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_using_a_project">Using a project</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Projects are a top level concept to help you organize your deployments. An
OpenShift project allows a community of users (or a user) to organize and manage
their content in isolation from other communities. Each project has its own
resources, policies (who can or cannot perform actions), and constraints (quotas
and limits on resources, etc). Projects act as a "wrapper" around all the
application services and endpoints you (or your teams) are using for your work.
For this first lab, we are going to use a project named <strong>smoke</strong> that has been
created and populated with an application for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During this lab, we are going to use a few different commands to make sure that
things in the environment are working as expected.  Don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t
understand all of the terminology as we will cover it in detail in later labs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing we want to do is switch to the <strong>explore-XX</strong> project. You
can do this with the following command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock copypaste">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>$ oc project explore-XX</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You will see the following confirmation message:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>Now using project "explore-XX" on server "https://astri-ihub.org:8443".</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_web_console">The Web Console</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenShift ships with a web-based console that will allow users to
perform various tasks via a browser.  To get a feel for how the web console
works, open your browser and go to the following URL:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><a href="https://astri-ihub.org:8443" class="bare">https://astri-ihub.org:8443</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first screen you will see is the authentication screen.  Enter in the following credentials:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>Username: userXX
Password: openshift3</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/api/workshops/roadshow/content/assets/images/ocp-login.png" alt="OpenShift Login Screen">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After you have authenticated to the web console, you will be presented with a
list of projects that your user has permission to work with. You will see
something that looks like the following image:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/api/workshops/roadshow/content/assets/images/explore-webconsole1.png" alt="Web Console">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Click on the <strong>explore-XX</strong> project. When you click on the
<strong>explore-XX</strong> project, you will be taken to the project overview page
which will list all of the routes, services, deployments, and pods that you have
running as part of your project. There&#8217;s nothing there now, but that&#8217;s about to
change.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/api/workshops/roadshow/content/assets/images/explore-webconsole2.png" alt="Explore Project">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lastly, the web console will show you an error: <em>An error occurred getting
metrics.</em>  We need to accept another self-signed certificate for OpenShift&#8217;s metrics
aggregation. If we don&#8217;t, then the metrics will not display in the OpenShift UI.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Click the link that says <strong>Open metrics URL</strong>, and accept the certificate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will be using a mix of command line tooling and the web console for the labs.
Get ready!</p>
