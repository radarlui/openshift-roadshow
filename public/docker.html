<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s start by doing the simplest thing possible - get a plain old
Docker-formatted image to run on OpenShift. This is incredibly simple to do.
With OpenShift Container Platform 3.5 it can be done directly from the
web console.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Return to the web console:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Find your <strong>explore-XX</strong> project and click it. Next, click "Add to
project" at the top of the screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several options, but we are only concerned with "Deploy Image". Click
it. We will learn more about image streams and image stream tags later. For now,
select the "Image Name" option, and copy/paste the following into the box:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>docker.io/openshiftroadshow/parksmap:1.2.0</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your screen will end up looking something like this:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Either press <strong>enter</strong> or click on the magnifying glass. OpenShift will then go
out to the Docker registry specified and interrogate the image. You then are
presented with some options to add things like environment variables, labels,
and etc.&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which we will learn about later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hit the blue "Create" button at the bottom of the screen and then click the
"Continue to overview" link. Take a moment to look at the various messages that
you now see on the overview page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WINNING! These few steps are the only ones you need to run to get a "vanilla"
Docker-formatted image deployed on OpenShift. This should work with any
Docker-formatted image that follows best practices, such as defining an EXPOSE
port, not needing to run specifically as the <strong>root user</strong> or other user name, and
a single non-exiting CMD to execute on start.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_background_containers_and_pods">Background: Containers and Pods</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we start digging in we need to understand how containers and <strong>Pods</strong> are
related. Given the morning sessions where we discussed the OpenShift platform
and how it uses containers and <strong>Pods</strong>, we will not be covering the background on
these technologies in this lab.  Instead, we will dive right in and start using
them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In OpenShift, the smallest deployable unit is a <strong>Pod</strong>. A <strong>Pod</strong> is a group of one or
more Docker containers deployed together and guaranteed to be on the same host.
From the doc:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>Each pod has its own IP address, therefore owning its entire port space, and
containers within pods can share storage. Pods can be "tagged" with one or
more labels, which are then used to select and manage groups of pods in a
single operation.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Pods</strong> can contain multiple Docker instances. The general idea is for a Pod to
contain a "server" and any auxiliary services you want to run along with that
server. Examples of containers you might put in a <strong>Pod</strong> are, an Apache HTTPD
server, a log analyzer, and a file service to help manage uploaded files.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_exercise_examining_the_pod">Exercise: Examining the Pod</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the web console&#8217;s overview page you will see that there is a single <strong>Pod</strong> that
was created by your actions. This <strong>Pod</strong> contains a single container, which
happens to be the parks map application - a simple Spring Boot/Java application.</p>
</div>
<!--div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also examine <strong>Pods</strong> from the command line:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>$ oc get pod</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should see output that looks similar to:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
parksmap-1-hx0kv   1/1       Running   0          2m</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above output lists all of the <strong>Pods</strong> in the current <strong>Project</strong>, including the
<strong>Pod</strong> name, state, restarts, and uptime. Once you have a <strong>Pod</strong>'s name, you can
get more information about the <strong>Pod</strong> using the <strong>oc get</strong> command.  To make the
output readable, I suggest changing the output type to <strong>YAML</strong> using the
following syntax:</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>

<td class="content">
Make sure you use the correct <strong>Pod</strong> name from your output.

<p>Getting the parks map image running may take a little while to complete. Each
OpenShift node that is asked to run the image has to pull (download) it if the
node does not already have it cached locally. You can check on the status of the
image download and deployment in the <strong>Pod</strong> details page, or from the command
line with the <code>oc get pods</code> command that you used before.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_background_a_little_about_the_docker_daemon">Background: A Little About the Docker Daemon</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whenever OpenShift asks the node&#8217;s Docker daemon to run an image, the Docker
daemon will check to make sure it has the right "version" of the image to run.
If it doesn&#8217;t, it will pull it from the specified registry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a number of ways to customize this behavior. They are documented in
<a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/dev_guide/application_lifecycle/new_app.html#specifying-an-image">specifying an image</a>
as well as
<a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/dev_guide/managing_images.html#image-pull-policy">image pullpolicy</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_background_services">Background: Services</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Services</strong> provide a convenient abstraction layer inside OpenShift to find a
group of like <strong>Pods</strong>. They also act as an internal proxy/load balancer between
those <strong>Pods</strong> and anything else that needs to access them from inside the
OpenShift environment. For example, if you needed more parks map servers to
handle the load, you could spin up more <strong>Pods</strong>. OpenShift automatically maps
them as endpoints to the <strong>Service</strong>, and the incoming requests would not notice
anything different except that the <strong>Service</strong> was now doing a better job handling
the requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you asked OpenShift to run the image, it automatically created a <strong>Service</strong>
for you. Remember that services are an internal construct. They are not
available to the "outside world", or anything that is outside the OpenShift
environment. That&#8217;s OK, as you will learn later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The way that a <strong>Service</strong> maps to a set of <strong>Pods</strong> is via a system of <strong>Labels</strong> and
<strong>Selectors</strong>. <strong>Services</strong> are assigned a fixed IP address and many ports and
protocols can be mapped.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a lot more information about
<a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services">Services</a>,
including the YAML format to make one by hand, in the official documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we understand the basics of what a <strong>Service</strong> is, let&#8217;s take a look at
the <strong>Service</strong> that was created for the image that we just deployed.  In order to
view the <strong>Services</strong> defined in your <strong>Project</strong>, You can get there by clicking "Applications", then "Services", at the left.</p>

<p>In the above output, we can see that we have a <strong>Service</strong> named <code>parksmap</code> with an
