<div class="paragraph">
<p>While <strong>Services</strong> provide routing and load balancing for <strong>Pods</strong>, which may go in and
out of existence, <strong>ReplicationControllers</strong> (RC) are used to specify and then
ensure the desired number of <strong>Pods</strong> (replicas) are in existence. For example, if
you always want your application server to be scaled to 3 <strong>Pods</strong> (instances), a
<strong>ReplicationController</strong> is needed. Without an RC, any <strong>Pods</strong> that are killed or
somehow die/exit are not automatically restarted. <strong>ReplicationControllers</strong> are
how OpenShift "self heals".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>DeploymentConfiguration</strong> (DC) defines how something in OpenShift should be
deployed. From the <a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#deployments-and-deployment-configurations">deployments documentation</a>:</p>

<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>Building on replication controllers, OpenShift adds expanded support for the
software development and deployment lifecycle with the concept of deployments.
In the simplest case, a deployment just creates a new replication controller and
lets it start up pods. However, OpenShift deployments also provide the ability
to transition from an existing deployment of an image to a new one and also
define hooks to be run before or after creating the replication controller.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In almost all cases, you will end up using the <strong>Pod</strong>, <strong>Service</strong>,
<strong>ReplicationController</strong> and <strong>DeploymentConfiguration</strong> resources together. And, in
almost all of those cases, OpenShift will create all of them for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are some edge cases where you might want some <strong>Pods</strong> and an <strong>RC</strong> without a <strong>DC</strong>
or a <strong>Service</strong>, and others, so feel free to ask us about them after the labs.</p>

<h3 id="_exercise_exploring_deployment_related_objects">Exercise: Exploring Deployment-related Objects</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we know the background of what a <strong>ReplicatonController</strong> and
<strong>DeploymentConfig</strong> are, we can explore how they work and are related. Take a
look at the <strong>DeploymentConfig</strong> (DC) that was created for you when you told
OpenShift to stand up the <code>parksmap</code> image:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>$ oc get dc

NAME       REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get more details, we can look into the <strong>ReplicationController</strong> (<strong>RC</strong>).</p>

<p>Take a look at the <strong>ReplicationController</strong> (RC) that was created for you when

<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>$ oc get rc

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This lets us know that, right now, we expect one <strong>Pod</strong> to be deployed
(<code>Desired</code>), and we have one <strong>Pod</strong> actually deployed (<code>Current</code>). By changing
the desired number, we can tell OpenShift that we want more or less <strong>Pods</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenShift&#8217;s <strong>HorizontalPodAutoscaler</strong> effectively monitors the CPU usage of a
set of instances and then manipulates the RCs accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="_exercise_scaling_the_application">Exercise: Scaling the Application</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s scale our parksmap "application" up to 2 instances. We can do this by clicking the "up" arrow next to
the <strong>Pod</strong> in the OpenShift web console on the overview page.</p> 
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">

<!--div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>$ oc scale --replicas=2 dc/parksmap</code></pre>
</div>
</div-->
<!--div class="paragraph">
<p>To verify that we changed the number of replicas, issue the following command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>$ oc get rc

NAME         DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE

</div>
</div-->
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can see that we now have 2 replicas. Let&#8217;s view the list of pods by clicking the <strong>Pod</strong> circle</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/api/workshops/roadshow/content/assets/images/examinepods.png" alt="Scaling">

parksmap-1-hx0kv   1/1       Running   0          4h</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And lastly, let&#8217;s verify that the <strong>Service</strong> that we learned about in the
previous lab accurately reflects two endpoints:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>$ oc describe svc parksmap</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You will see something like the following output:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>Name:			parksmap
Namespace:		explore-XX
Labels:			app=parksmap
Selector:		deploymentconfig=parksmap
Type:			ClusterIP
IP:			172.30.169.213
Port:			8080-tcp	8080/TCP
Endpoints:		10.1.0.5:8080,10.1.1.5:8080
Session Affinity:	None
No events.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another way to look at a <strong>Service</strong>'s endpoints is with the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>$ oc get endpoints parksmap</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And you will see something like the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>NAME       ENDPOINTS                                   AGE
parksmap   10.1.0.5:8080,10.1.1.5:8080                 4h</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your IP addresses will likely be different, as each pod receives a unique IP
within the OpenShift environment. The endpoint list is a quick way to see how
many pods are behind a service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also see that both <strong>Pods</strong> are running using the web console:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/api/workshops/roadshow/content/assets/images/parksmap-scaled.png" alt="Scaling">
</div>
</div-->
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Overall, that&#8217;s how simple it is to scale an application (<strong>Pods</strong> in a
<strong>Service</strong>). Application scaling can happen extremely quickly because OpenShift
is just launching new instances of an existing image, especially if that image
is already cached on the node.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_application_self_healing">Application "Self Healing"</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because OpenShift&#8217;s <strong>RCs</strong> are constantly monitoring to see that the desired number
of <strong>Pods</strong> actually is running, you might also expect that OpenShift will "fix" the
situation if it is ever not right. You would be correct!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since we have two <strong>Pods</strong> running right now, let&#8217;s see what happens if we
"accidentally" kill one. Navigate to the list of <strong>Pod</strong> by clicking the <strong>Pod</strong> circle in the overview page and then clicking on one of the <strong>Pod</strong> name to navigate to the detail of the <strong>Pod</strong> page.</p> 
<!--Then, do the following:</p-->
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/api/workshops/roadshow/content/assets/images/containerdetail.png" alt="Pod Detail">
</div>
</div>
<!--div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code>$ oc delete pod parksmap-1-hx0kv &amp;&amp; oc get pods

pod "parksmap-1-h45hj" deleted

</div>
</div-->
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, do the following:<br/>
Select the <strong>Delete</strong> action under the right side <strong>"Actions"</strong> dropdown button. A confirmation prompt will be shown, select the <strong>Delete</strong> button.  
</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/api/workshops/roadshow/content/assets/images/deletepod.png" alt="Delete Pod">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Did you notice anything? There is a container being terminated (the one we deleted),
and there&#8217;s a new container already being created.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, the names of the <strong>Pods</strong> are slightly changed.
That&#8217;s because OpenShift almost immediately detected that the current state (1
<strong>Pod</strong>) didn&#8217;t match the desired state (2 <strong>Pods</strong>), and it fixed it by scheduling
another <strong>Pod</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, OpenShift provides rudimentary capabilities around checking the
liveness and/or readiness of application instances. If the basic checks are
insufficient, OpenShift also allows you to run a command inside the container in
order to perform the check. That command could be a complicated script that uses
any installed language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based on these health checks, if OpenShift decided that our <code>parksmap</code>
application instance wasn&#8217;t alive, it would kill the instance and then restart
it, always ensuring that the desired number of replicas was in place.</p>
